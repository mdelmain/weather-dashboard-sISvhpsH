# 06 Weather Dashboard

## Description 
For the module 6 assignment I built a weather dashboard in JavaScript. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather data for a city along with a 5 day forecast. There is also a search history section that saves up to 10 cities in local storage. The last city that was searched is added to the top of the list. 

The webpage can be found here: https://mdelmain.github.io/weather-dashboard-sISvhpsH

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The webpage displays the current weather data and 5 day forecast when the user searches for a city.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
